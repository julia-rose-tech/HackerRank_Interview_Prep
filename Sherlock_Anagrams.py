# Complete the 'sherlockAndAnagrams' function below.

# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts STRING s as parameter.
#
# Two strings are anagrams of each other if the letters of one string can be rearranged to form the other string. Given a string, find the number of pairs of substrings of the string that are anagrams of each other.

# Example: s = "MOM", answer = 2. MM = MM and OM = MO

# The list of all anagrammatic pairs is  at positions  respectively.

s = "kkkk" 
# answer = 10

    # the splice is "sorted" before added to the dictionary

        first_substring = str(''.join(sorted(s[:i])))
